<p Dance Paragraph>



  I learned KPop Dance since seventh grade. As a child of two immigrant parents,
  Korean culture is an important part of my identity. This includes Korean tradition,
  language, and politics, but also film, music, and dance!
  I am incredibly proud to be a Korean that boasts great scholars,
  gamers, and athletes as well as films like Parasite, KPop groups like BTS, and more.
  I hoped to exhibit that I am not a serious person only focused on work,
  but that I am an incredibly fun person with cool talents! Although
  I had never been a great dancer, I love to ride the rhythm and demonstrate KPop moves to my friends!
  In 2018, I participated in a five person KPop dance team called Got5 that
  performed Just Right by Got7 at a Korean festival in Los Angeles.
  In 2019, I was the master of ceremonies at the Korean festival where I used
  both Korean and English as well as my background in KPop Dance to introduce KPop performers
  in front of thousands of people
